# Data Analysis

When we encounter energy data from the field, it is most often in the form of repeated measurement over time.
This is called a timeseries.

We can learn a lot by looking directly at a graph of the timeseries.

# Descriptive statistics

We can also learn a lot about energy use from taking descriptive statistics from power measurements or daily energy measurements.

- Mean
- Median
- Maximum
- Minimum
- Quartiles

These numbers can tell you about what equipment will be needed.

For example, the maximum power observed is important for having the right gauge of wire or size of transformer to handle the highest demand.
