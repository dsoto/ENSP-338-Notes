# Basic principles of electricity
- Ohms Law
- Electromagnetic Induction
- Alternating Current

# Model thinking
- A model is an approximation that allows us to understand and make
  predictions about a system
- All are models are wrong, some are useful
- How do you separate the important factors in a model from the less
  significant?
- How do you determine which models to use?
- Ohm's Law is a model


# Research skills
- How do you discover more about a topic?
- How do you synthesize this information to answer a question?
- How do you find the right question to ask?


# Introduction
- Why is this topic important?
- Electricity is a significant energy use in our society
- Electricity is primarily generated with coal which creates climate
  risk and health impacts



# Electricity System
- Incredibly large and complex
- Evolved over time
- Has significant problems
